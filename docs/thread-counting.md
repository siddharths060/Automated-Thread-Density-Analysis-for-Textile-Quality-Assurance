# üìè Thread Counting: Principles and Methodology

![Thread Count Illustration](assets/thread-count-illustration.png)

## What Is Thread Count?

Thread count is a fundamental quality metric in the textile industry that quantifies the number of threads woven into one square inch of fabric. It is calculated as the sum of warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads:

```
Thread Count = Warp Thread Count + Weft Thread Count
```

For example, a fabric with 128 warp threads and 92 weft threads per square inch has a thread count of 220.

## Thread Types and Terminology

### Warp Threads

Warp threads run vertically in the fabric (parallel to the selvage edge). They are:
- Usually stronger and more tightly twisted
- Under higher tension during the weaving process
- Often referred to as the "backbone" of the fabric

### Weft Threads

Weft threads (also called filling threads) run horizontally in the fabric (perpendicular to the selvage edge). They are:
- Generally softer and less twisted than warp threads
- Inserted over and under the warp threads during weaving
- Determine much of the fabric's feel and appearance

## Industry Relevance of Thread Count

Thread count is a critical quality indicator in various textile applications:

### Bedding and Household Linens

- **Sheets**: Higher thread counts (200-800) are associated with premium quality
- **Pillowcases**: Medium to high thread counts (300-600) for comfort and durability
- **Tablecloths**: Medium thread counts (180-300) for durability with softness

### Apparel

- **Shirts**: 100-200 thread count for breathability and comfort
- **Suiting**: 150-250 thread count for structure and drape
- **Technical sportswear**: Varying thread counts depending on performance requirements

### Technical Textiles

- **Medical textiles**: Controlled thread counts for specific filtration or barrier properties
- **Industrial fabrics**: Thread count determines strength, filtration capabilities, and durability
- **Protective clothing**: Higher thread counts for better protection against hazards

## The Science Behind Thread Counting

### Traditional Manual Counting

Traditional thread counting is performed using a thread counter (pick glass):

1. A magnifying device with a precise 1-inch square marking is placed on the fabric
2. A skilled technician counts warp and weft threads within this square
3. The process is repeated at multiple locations for accuracy
4. The average counts determine the final thread count

### Automated Thread Counting

Our system's automated approach follows these steps:

1. **Image Capture**: High-resolution digital image of fabric is obtained
2. **Preprocessing**: Image is normalized, enhanced, and prepared for analysis
3. **Deep Learning Segmentation**: U-Net model identifies individual threads
4. **Thread Separation**: Computer vision techniques separate warp and weft threads
5. **Counting Algorithm**: Specialized algorithms count distinct threads
6. **Results Calibration**: Counts are calibrated to a standardized one-inch measurement

## Understanding Thread Count Results

### How Our Model Interprets Threads

The model uses several visual characteristics to identify and distinguish threads:

1. **Orientation**: 
   - Warp threads appear as vertical lines
   - Weft threads appear as horizontal lines

2. **Continuity**:
   - Threads are continuous lines with consistent width
   - The model differentiates between threads and background

3. **Intersections**:
   - Thread crossover points are identified
   - The model maintains thread identity through intersections

4. **Edge Detection**:
   - Thread edges are enhanced using specialized filters
   - High-contrast boundaries improve counting accuracy

### Example Detection

## Thread Count and Fabric Quality

### Correlation Between Thread Count and Quality

| Thread Count Range | Typical Quality Level | Common Applications |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 80-180 | Basic/Standard | Everyday clothing, casual bedding |
| 180-300 | Good | Quality bedding, business attire |
| 300-500 | Premium | Luxury bedding, high-end apparel |
| 500-1000+ | Ultra Premium | Finest linens, exclusive luxury products |

### Factors Beyond Thread Count

Thread count alone doesn't determine quality. Other important factors include:

1. **Fiber Quality**: Long-staple cotton with high thread count outperforms short-staple cotton with the same count
2. **Yarn Construction**: Single-ply vs. multi-ply yarns affect fabric performance
3. **Weave Pattern**: Percale, sateen, and twill weaves create different fabric properties
4. **Finishing Processes**: Chemical and mechanical treatments affect final feel and appearance

### Industry Standards

Several organizations provide standards for thread count measurement:

- **ASTM International**: ASTM D3775 - Standard Test Method for Warp End Count and Filling Pick Count
- **ISO**: ISO 7211-2 - Textiles - Woven fabrics - Construction - Methods of analysis
- **AATCC**: American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists Test Method 76

## Mathematical Formulation

### Thread Count Calculation

For a standard 1-inch square:

```
TC = W + F
```

Where:
- TC = Thread Count (threads per square inch)
- W = Warp thread count (vertical threads per inch)
- F = Weft thread count (horizontal threads per inch)

### Density Calculation

For comparison across different fabric types:

```
Thread Density = TC / (W_width + F_width)
```

Where:
- TC = Thread Count
- W_width = Average width of warp threads (mm)
- F_width = Average width of weft threads (mm)

This density measurement helps compare fabrics with different thread thicknesses.
