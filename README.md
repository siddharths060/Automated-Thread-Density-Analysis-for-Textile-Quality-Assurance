An end-to-end solution for automated thread counting in textile fabrics to determine quality metrics using computer vision and deep learning.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Thread count is a critical quality metric in textile manufacturing that traditionally requires manual counting - a tedious, error-prone process. This project automates thread density analysis using deep learning, providing:

- Accurate thread counting for quality assurance
- Consistent evaluation across fabric samples
- Significant time savings compared to manual methods
- Objective measurement without human bias

## 🧠 How Thread Count Works

Thread count is the sum of warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads per square inch of fabric:

```
Thread Count = Warp Thread Count + Weft Thread Count
```

Higher thread counts often indicate higher quality fabrics, especially in bedsheets, clothing, and technical textiles.

## 🔍 U-Net Model for Thread Detection

This project implements an enhanced U-Net architecture with a ResNet backbone for semantic segmentation of fabric images. The U-Net model was chosen for its ability to:

- Preserve fine details through skip connections
- Segment thin structures (individual threads)
- Maintain context while detecting local patterns
- Perform well with limited training data

Our implementation combines advanced preprocessing techniques with deep learning to achieve high accuracy in thread detection.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Interactive UI for image uploading and result visualization
- **Material UI**: Modern component library for responsive design
- **Chart.js**: Visualization of thread count metrics and distributions
- **Axios**: API communication with backend
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing framework

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: High-performance Python web framework
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for model inference
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library for image processing
- **Pytest**: Testing framework for backend components
- **NumPy/SciPy**: Scientific computing for numerical operations

## 🚀 How It Works

![System Architecture](docs/assets/architecture-diagram.png)

1. User uploads a fabric image through the React frontend
2. Backend preprocesses the image (normalization, enhancement)
3. U-Net model generates a segmentation mask highlighting threads
4. Post-processing algorithms separate and count warp/weft threads
5. Results are returned to the frontend for visualization
6. Thread count metrics and annotated images are displayed to the user
